My name is Chengyi Ju. I was borned and raised in Guangzhou, China. Tell the world about yourself. Currently I am an machine learning engineer working in the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). I am one of the member of the Computational Linguistics and Intelligence group at ASTRI, our group mainly works on large language models and speech recognition. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to multi-modality data analysis and generative AI research.

Before this, I worked as a research assistant in the Internet and Mobile Computing Lab with the Department of Computing, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Prof. Jiannong Cao. I graduated from South China University of Technology (SCUT) with a BSc dual degree from the University of Birmingham (via 3+1 joint training programme) majoring in Mathematics and a MSc degree majoring in AI & Machine Learning in 2021.  

I am both a moba and FPS game player. (10 years' game career for LOL and 5 yearas for PUBG) Besides, I also love Monster Hunter and other 3A games. This is the link to my [stream](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198434869665/). Besides, Steph Curry is my favourite basketball player in NBA.
