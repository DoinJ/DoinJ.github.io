I was borned and raised in Guangzhou, China, currently working as a machine learning and software development engineer at the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). At ASTRI, I'm part of the Computational Linguistics and Intelligence team. I am also a Phd student at the Hong Kong University of Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Yike Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yikeguo). My research mainlly focus on Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI).

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/). I graduated from South China University of Technology with a BSc in Mathematics and the University of Birmingham with a MSc in AI & Machine Learning. 

In my free time, I'm an avid gamer with a decade of experience in League of Legends and five years in PUBG. I also enjoy Monster Hunter and various other 3A games. This is the link to my [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198434869665/). Besides, I'm a big fan of NBA star Steph Curry.
