I was borned and raised in Guangzhou, China, currently working as a machine learning and software development engineer at [ASTRI](https://www.astri.org/). At ASTRI, I'm part of the Computational Linguistics and Intelligence team. I am also a Phd student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Yike Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yikeguo). My research mainlly focus on Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI).

Previously, I was a research assistant at [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/). I graduated from [SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) with a BSc in Mathematics and [UOB](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/) with a MSc in AI & Machine Learning. 

I also enjoy playing basketball and various video games. This is the link to my [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198434869665/).
