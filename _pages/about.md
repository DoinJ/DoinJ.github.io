I was borned and raised in Guangzhou, China, currently working at the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). At ASTRI, I'm part of the Computational Linguistics and Intelligence group, focusing on large language models and speech recognition. My goal is to contribute to advancements in multi-modality data analysis and generative AI.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/). I hold a dual BSc degree in Mathematics from South China University of Technology and the University of Birmingham, as well as a MSc in AI & Machine Learning. 

In my free time, I'm an avid gamer with a decade of experience in League of Legends and five years in PUBG. I also enjoy Monster Hunter and various other 3A games. This is the link to my [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198434869665/). Besides, I'm a big fan of NBA star Steph Curry.
